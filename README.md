# IndiaStates_JSON: The Ultimate Resource for Up-to-Date Indian Maps

Looking for an accurate, up-to-date JSON file for India’s states and union territories? You're in the right place! 

Many of the older maps available online, whether on GitHub or Google, are outdated — missing key states like Telangana and several union territories that have been formed in recent years. That’s where **innsss.json**(ignore the naming please) comes in.

This repository is your go-to source for a comprehensive, **updated map** of India, with all the latest additions and changes. I’ve carefully curated the data to ensure that you get a **reliable, accurate representation** of India’s political boundaries. Whether you're a developer working on an app, a researcher, or just someone who needs the most current Indian map, this JSON file has got you covered.

feel free to use it!!
